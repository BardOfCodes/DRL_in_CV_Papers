#### Problem Statement
This paper proposes a novel tracker which is controlled by sequentially pursuing actions learned by deep reinforcement learning. In contrast to the existing trackers using deep networks, the proposed tracker is designed to achieve a light computation as well as satisfactory tracking accuracy in both location and scale. The deep network to control actions is pre-trained using various training sequences and fine-tuned during tracking for online adaptation to target and background changes. Through evaluation of the OTB dataset, the proposed tracker is validated to achieve a competitive performance that is three times faster than state-of-the-art, deep network–based trackers.

#### RL Components
The problem has been modeled as a Markov Decision Process. Formally, the MDP has a set of actions A, a set of states S, and a reward function R.
* Actions
The action space A consists of eleven types of actions including translation moves, scale changes, and stopping action. The translation moves
include four directional moves, {left, right, up, down} and also have their two times larger moves. The scale changes are defined as two types, {scale up, scale down}, which maintain the aspect ratio of the tracking target. Each action is encoded by the 11-dimensional vector with one-hot form.

* State Space
The state is defined as a tuple (p, d), where p denotes the image patch within the bounding box (we call simply “patch” in the following)
and d represents the dynamics of actions denoted by a vector (called by “action dynamics vector” in the following) containing the previous k actions.

* Rewards
The reward function is defined as r(s) since the agent obtains the reward by the state s regardless of the action a. The reward $r(s_{t})$ keeps zero during iteration in MDP in a frame. At the termination step T, that is, a T is ‘stop’ action, $r(s_T)$ is assigned by,

#### Why use Reinforcement Learing here?
Reinforcement learning makes the use of partially labeled data possible, which could greatly benefit actual applications. According to the
evaluation results, the proposed tracker achieves a state-of-the-art performance in 3 fps, which is three times faster than the existing deep network-based trackers adopting a tracking-by-detection strategy. Furthermore, the fast version of the proposed tracker achieves a real-time speed (15 fps) with an accuracy that outperforms state-of-the-art real-time trackers.
